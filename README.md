Installing
=================================
----------------------------------------------------------------

After you finish downloading and extracting the Tutis Login's .zip file, move all the contents in the Tutis Login folder to your site. This folder contains all the files needed to run the P.I.G.S script.

You will see a index.php file, this is just a demo file. If you do not wish to use the index.php as your secure page and wish to get the script running, add the follow code in your page at the very top.

><?php
>
>	include("assets/member.inc.php");
>
>	$member->LoggedIn();
>
>?>

In the member.inc.php file change the following lines to your database info

>/* Start an instance of the Database Class */

>$database = new database("hostname name here", "database name here", "username here", "password here");

Next import the sql.sql file into your database, and your done!
